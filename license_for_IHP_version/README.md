# Free license file for RFIC Inductor Toolkit, IHP Edition

The Open Source version of inductor toolkit in this repository is preconfigured for GPDK demo technology.

If you want to use it with IHP technology, you don't need to configure Inductor Toolkit for IHP technology yourself: we now provide a free license here to enable ALL features of Inductor Toolkit IHP Edition that is available on the IHP servers. 

Note: Inductor Toolkit Open in this repository comes with all source files, and all license file stuff was removed from Inductor Toolkit Open. The IHP Edition available on IHP servers is still the "old" PDK from the days when this was commercial software, so you need to install a license file, but that license file is now available for free here.

To use this fully-featured free license, remove the existing license.lic from the license directory, and replace it with the generic_free_license.lic provided here.
